1001 NIGHTS - FANTASY ARABIC 
Compiled by Meguey Baker
NOTES
These names are taken from the 1001 Nights collected by Andrew Lang, with a few additions. If you feel the need for a character with a full name, an easy way is to choose 'Name ibn Father's Name' for a male and 'Name bint Father's Name' for a female. Being known only as 'Ibn Father's Name' would be common and fine. 'Name al-Adjective' (as 'the Lionhearted', the Bald' etc.) is very common for men, far less so for women. Adding 'Baba' before a name is a handy familiar honorific, as 'Uncle' would be. Women are often honored as 'Umm (mother of) Child's Name, Name'. For nobility, Amir and Amira for Prince and Princess is easy.
