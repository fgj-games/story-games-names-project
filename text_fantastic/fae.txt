FAE PUBLIC NAMES
Complied by Arref Mak
NOTES
With inspirations by Roger Zelazny's Lord Demon
Immortal Fae do not give out their names, so they take artistic syllables that are suggestive riddles and clues to who they really are (if you know a hundred languages and dozens of cultures you might see the clues.) Three syllables are usually used for the beauty of the asymmetry in a formal naming; the last two syllables are not a clan/blood/family name.  No signature syllable like fae, fey, fai, or such is used at all. These sounds mean 'power' and refer to the entire race.

TITLES
There are elegant and mysterious titles that attach themselves to Fae over time and are not explained. They follow the formal name, as in Kai Wren Hu of the Thousand Boxes. These titles are rare since acknowledging them across clans is a historical honor and requires significant events in the immortal perspective (such as maiming a god.)
