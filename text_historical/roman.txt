ROMAN
Compiled by Jessica Hammer
NOTES
The praenomen is a name which distinguishes you from other members of your family.  Only men have praenomens, and they are rarely actually used except within the family.  The praenomina listed are the ONLY common praenomina within Rome.
The nomen is a family name, which indicates which 'gens' (collection of families) you belong to.  People with the same nomen are either directly related to each other, or closely politically affiliated.  The names listed here are a representative sampling, but do comprise a large proportion of the existing names; new citizens would take the name of an existing gens instead of inventing new ones.
The cognomen is the most commonly used name, which was assigned by the community or by your family.  You can think of it as analogous to a nickname.  These names were generally descriptive and often insulting.  For example, someone who drank too much might be called 'Bibulus.'  Alternately, the name can be sarcastic.  Someone who doesn't drink at all could also be called 'Bibulus.'  They are often (but not always) passed down within a family.  People can also accumulate multiple cognomena, ususally for outstanding characteristics such as great victory in battle.  Most words can be used as cognomena, particularly if there is some kind of story behind it.  The names here are simply examples.
All names here are listed in their masculine forms.  Names are feminized by replacing "-us" with "-a" when necessary, though many cognomens do not require feminization as they do not all end in "-us."
To create a male Roman name, choose one praenomen, one nomen, and one cognomen.  For example: Gaius Julius Caesar. 
To create a female Roman name, choose and feminize one nomen and one optional cognomen.  Girls were often numbered instead of being given actual cognomens.  For example: Flavia Tertia.

COGNOMEN
There are several special types of cognomena that may also be appropriate.  While there are not twenty of them, the other types are listed here:
- Geographical: the city, region or tribe you are from.  For example, "Sabinus" means "Man of the Sabine tribe."
- Honorific: often given after a great military victory to all who participated.  For example, "Germanicus" means that you or an ancestor participated in the subdual of some Germanic tribe.  Alternately, it could describe some great virtue, such as "Magnus" (generous) or "Pius" (dutiful).  These names are always awarded by others and can never be chosen by the individual.  Acquiring an honorific is an honor for the entire family.
- Occupational: describing what you do.  Some are listed above, such as "Caprarius" which means "goat-herd."
- Non-Roman: if you are not Roman, you may keep a Romanized version of your name when you become a citizen.  For example, "Idir" is a Berber name which could be used as a cognomen.
- Adoptive: if you are adopted, you take the cognomen of your adoptive father, but you keep your original cognomen as a second cognomen.  The adoption is indicated by replacing the "-ius" ending with an "-ianus" ending in your original cognomen.
