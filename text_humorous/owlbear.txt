OWLBEAR
Compiled by the Story Games Owlbear Fan Club
NOTES
Owlbears, perhaps the most enlightened and inclusive culture of red-eyed maniacal predators to grace the planet, embrace a mashup approach to the naming of their chickubs:  A combination of the names of a respected grandparent and a close friend, perhaps, or sometimes simply a juxtaposition of the names of their parents.  Or maybe you're supposed to have two genders in your first name and two cultures in your surname.  Wait, are they hermaphrodites?  Somebody go get the book.
