There are no surnames, instead people are often introduced as son of (sin) or daughter of (hči). To indicate posession, male names gain the suffix -a and female gain the suffix -e, replacing a vowel if the name ends in one. For example Rastislava hči Volkonje.

PRONOUNCIATION
Carons: Ž is pronounced similar to the g in mirage. Č is pronounced similar to ch in chocolate. Š is pronounced as sh in show.
Vowels: Try to pronounce a as the a in cola, e as in energy (and not in eat) and o as the o in show, i is pronounced like the i in internet.
Consonants: J is pronounced as y in yahoo.
There are some other twists that would be hard to explain or don't even have rules.
