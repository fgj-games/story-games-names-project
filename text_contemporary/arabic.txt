ARABIC NAMES
Compiled by Eric J. Boyd
NOTES
Arabic names are composed of several parts:
(1) The ism - A personal proper name given shortly after birth. The male and female names listed below can all serve as isms. Adults are seldom referred to by these names, and it is an insult to refer to your elders by their ism.
(2) The kunya - An honorific as the father or mother of someone. Consists of Abu (father of) [Name] or Umm (mother of) [Name]. The name inserted is always that of the father or mother's first born son. Married persons are usually referred to by their kunyas. When writing out a full name, the person's kunya always precedes their ism.
(3) The nasab - A name showing that you are the son (ibn or sometimes bin) or daughter (bint) of your father or prior generation male relative. When included in a nasab, a kunya is converted to Abi instead of Abu (e.g., Ibn Abi Talib). A nasab follows the ism when listing a person's full name and generally does not go back more than one or two generations.
(4) The laqab - A religious epithet or descriptive name. Usually one in the form of Abdul (Servant of - male) or Amatul (Servant of -female) followed by one of the 99 names of Allah. Laqabs follow the ism. In some cases, a laqab can serve as an ism for a person, fulfilling its role in their name.
(5) The nisba - A name indicating occupation, tribe of descent, or geographical origin. Generally follows the ism or nasab, if there is one.
Not all of these pieces need to be used in any one person's name. Mix and match as you see fit for good Arabian flavor.
When a modern Arab person's name is Westernized to a given name and surname, it is usually an ism and either nasab or nisba that are used.
