NOTES
The bulk of these names are ones you might hear walking around in Mumbai in the modern day; they come from a variety of northern languages, such as Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, and Marathi. The folkloric ones are less common, and more clearly Sanskrit-derived; older people are more likely to have such names. European and south Indian names are not unheard of either.
Naming practices vary immensely by language and region. In the vicinity of Mumbai, people often follow the English practice of taking a first name and a family name, inherited down the male line; this family name is frequently a caste term. Middle names are frequently the father or husband's first name. Another common practice is to take the father's name as a family name; for instance, Vikranth Sumanjit (abbreviated S. Vikranth) is the son of D. Sumanjit, and so on.
The list has a Hindu bias. Muslims use these names as well, although they also use Arabic names and surnames. Some of the family names, all in SURNAMES 1, are Hindu religious names; Muslims are unlikely to have these. The folkloric lists are also filled with religious names.
